# Disclaimer 
1. This project was for my job from the summer of 2024.
   
2. Although I made it, I forgot to download the file for the prototype of the game from the original computer it was on, along with the enemy behavior.
   So there is no visuals on what exactly I created. 
   
3. However, I did manage to salvage some of the code since I sent it over to my notes before the program ended.
   But this could mean that some of the code could be incorrect due to how it was copied.

# Player Movement 
1. For starters, we have the playable character already programmed with the basic abilities to move left and right with the arrow keys. 

2. The character can do basic movements like jumping. But it can also do a double jump in middair along with being able to climb walls. This can all be done by pressing the Space Bar.

3. The wall jump mechanic was supposed to behave similar to what you would see in the Mario games, but it ended up controlling similar to how Megaman X handles this feature.

# Background and Main World
1. In Godot, the background and main world were complete.
   
2. The background was programmed to move along as the player was moving through the level.
   
3. As for the main world, that was to be the main play area for the player to run and jump around on.
